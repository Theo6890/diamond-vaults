# <h1 align="center"> Diamond Vaults </h1>

The goal of this repository is to implement the diamond pattern (ERC-2535) through DeFi vaults.

# Technical Specifications

All vaults will use the same diamond to store their common data. A vault is a facet of a diamond, as there can be many types of vault with different logic implementation.

## Versions

### Vault Commons Specifications

-   **Yields percentage and timelock** varies from vaults to vaults
    -   Generally speaking the longest you lock, the highest the rewards
-   Deposit automatically timelock the transfered amount of ETH/tokens
-   Receive proportional amount of shares depending on the ETH/tokens amount deposited
-   Earn yield as soon as ETH/tokens are deposited
-   Yields are by default paid in RCODE (project token)
-   Claim rewards after the time setup by the vault
    _Note: in diamond storage for deposited balance, save the deposited type (native ETH, tokens, NFTs) and sub-type (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-777, ERC-721, ERC-1155...)_

### v0.1.0: ETH Vaults

-   Deposit ETH & mint shares through a dedicated function
-   Withdraw ETH & burn shares through a dedicated function

### v1.0.0: Add ERC20 Vaults Suuport

-   Deposit whitelisted ERC20 & mint shares through a dedicated function
-   Withdraw whitelisted ERC20 & burn shares through a dedicated function
-   Deposit using permit function for gas optimisation:
    -   Deposit tokens
    -   _Other actions: TO LIST_

#### v1.1.0: DEXs Integration

Will surely use Uniswap, maybe 1inch.

-   Support whitelisted LP tokens to earn yields
-   Connect DEXs to manage on-chain swap:
    -   claim rewards and swap them (if possible) in the given array of token(s)
    -   direct LP tokens swap: add liquidity on DEXs & deposit LP token in the vault for yields

### v2.0.0: NFT Vaults & Royalities

-   Support whitelisted NFT collections in vaults
-   Percentage of earned rewards will be paid to NFT creator as royalties

#### _Questions_

-   _RFT integration?_

### v3.0.0: Streaming Payment Protocol

Integrate [sablier.finance](http://sablier.finance) or [superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance).
Maybe later both of them.

-   Pay rewards in real time if the user set it up:
    -   each address/user must configure to enable (disabled by default)
    -   default config for all vaults
    -   one configuration
    -   forward rewards to another wallet
    -   timeframe payment

#### _Questions_

-   _Swap rewards & stream payment_

### v4.0.0: Multisig Vaults

-   Some vaults only useable with/by multisig

#### _Questions_

-   _Can Safe multisig interact with our contract without any extra code? If not implement it (Safe plugins?)_
-   _Can a multisig by the owner to manage upgrades of anything without any extra code? If not implement it (Safe plugins?)_

## EIPs To Use

### v0.1.0

-   2535: dimaonds
-   4626: vault

### v2.0.0

-   195 & 1820: interfaces registries
-   2981: NFT royalities

### v3.0.0

# Be Prepared For Audits

-   Well refactored & commented code (NatSpec comment & [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/starting))
-   Unit (TDD) & integration (BDD) tests (green)
-   _Paper code review (architecture & conception tests) - not required for this project_
-   Use auditing tools (internally)
